# Monitoring and Alerting Strategy (Optional)

*Only complete this if you have time after the core requirements*

## Key Metrics to Track

### Business Metrics
- Appointment booking success rate
- Coach utilization and distribution fairness
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Webhook delivery success rate

### Critical Alerts
- Booking failures > 1%
- API response time p95 > 500ms
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Webhook retry queue growing > 100

## Implementation Approach

### Where I'd Add Instrumentation
```javascript
// Example: Track booking success
function bookAppointment(data) {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  try {
    // booking logic
    logMetric('appointment.booked', 1);
    logMetric('appointment.booking_time', Date.now() - startTime);
  } catch (error) {
    logMetric('appointment.failed', 1);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Logs to Generate
- Appointment creation with coach assignment reason
- Webhook retry attempts with failure reasons
- Race condition conflicts when they occur

### Dashboards Needed
1. **Real-time Operations**: Current bookings, API health, error rates
2. **Coach Performance**: Distribution metrics, utilization rates
3. **System Health**: Database connections, memory usage, response times

## Production Considerations
- Use structured logging (JSON format)
- Include trace IDs for request correlation
- Sample high-volume endpoints to control costs
- Set up PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
